# PriceCalc-iOS

### By: Ben Schwartz

PriceCalc-iOS is an iOS app that calculates the amount each person owes in a group food order, taking into account taxes and delivery fees. This tool is useful for splitting food orders between multiple people and ensuring that each person pays their fair share. 


Please note this was created a while ago, and you will probably have to do some work to get this running in an Xcode simulator.
