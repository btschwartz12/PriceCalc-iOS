# PriceCalc-iOS

### By: Ben Schwartz



PriceCalc-iOS is an iOS app that calculates the amount each person owes in a group food order, taking into account taxes and delivery fees. This tool is useful for splitting food orders between multiple people and ensuring that each person pays their fair share. 


Please note this was created a while ago, and you will probably have to do some work to get this running in an Xcode simulator.


## Welp
*I just found out that the ViewController file was lost when I transferred this over, and is unrecoverable. This is pretty bad, since it is the entire model of the application. The UI and meta stuff is still here, but one day I will come back to reimplement the ViewController. Sorry :(*
